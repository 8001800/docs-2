# MPX

MPX provides users a platform to allow minting, redemption and trading of MARKET Protocol Position Tokens 

MPX is currently running on mainnet, with limited functionality [here](https://mpexchange.io/).

## Using an Ethereum-enabled browser

For interacting with MPX, you will need to use a browser that supports Web3. 
We recommend using the [Metamask Chrome Browser Extension](https://metamask.io/). This will enable you to connect to the 
Ethereum network from your browser. Metamask allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.

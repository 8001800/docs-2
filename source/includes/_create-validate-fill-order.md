# Tutorial - Orders

This tutorial will go over creating, validating and filling an order using our library MARKET.js

## Installation

In order to simplify app developers interaction with our underlying smart contracts and the ethereum
blockchain, we have create the MARKET.js library to provide a standardized and simplified API to interact
with the underlying MARKET Protocol.  In order to create a development environment, you will need to create
a local instance of the blockchain to interact with.  For this we recommend using [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/)

We have also created a demo starter project to help with these tutorials available on [github](https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/demo-projects).

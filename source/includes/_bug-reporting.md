# Bug Reporting

If you find bugs, mistakes or inconsistencies, please let us know by filing an issue on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/MARKETProtocol/issues) (see details bellow). We highly appreciate 
you taking the time to contributing to MARKET Protocol.


We use [GitHub](https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/) for many aspects of project management, 
including recording meeting notes, outstanding decisions, documenting requests, and filing bugs. 
Therefore, if you ever find a bug in any of our applications, please report it on GitHub. See details below.

## What's GitHub?

GitHub is a version control system, a place where developers store their code. It's the place where 
our community stores all the code for our entire project.

GitHub allows groups of developers to collaborate on the same documents (often source code) 
simultaneously and without overriding each otherâ€™s work.

## Security Issues

The MARKET Protocol and its implementations are still in early development, which means there may be problems with the
protocol or in our implementations. We take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue,
please bring it to our attention right away!

If you find a vulnerability please send your report privately to [support@marketprotocol.io](mailto:support@marketprotocol.io) Please DO NOT file a public issue.

If the issue is a protocol weakness or something not yet deployed, feel free to discuss it openly.

# dApp

The MARKET Protocol dApp provides tools for contract creation, oracle testing and deployment. 
Additionally, users are able to easily search previously deployed MARKET contracts they would 
like to trade.

A simulated trading environment allows user to place test trades and participate in beta
releases of the protocol.

## Contract Deployment

MARKET Protocol creates a flexible contract specification which allows users to easily implement
their desired contract prior to trading.  First time users, can use our 
[Guided Deploy](https://dapp.marketprotocol.io/contract/deploy?mode=guided) process
walking them through the step by step process to deployment.  Expert users, can opt for a more
condensed process with the [Quick Deploy](https://dapp.marketprotocol.io/contract/deploy?mode=quick) 

### Guided Deploy

## Find Contracts

The [Find Contracts](https://dapp.marketprotocol.io/contract/find) screen allows for a reverse lookup

a known address, if valid, the dApp will display the current specifcations of the MARKET Contract
deployed to this address.

MARKET Protocol provides the first opportunity for crypto holders to gain exposure to real-world or crypto assets through derivatives. A derivative is a contract between two parties with its value derived from an underlying asset. MARKET users will be able to design and implement contracts deriving value from digital and non-digital assets settling on the Ethereum blockchain. Users are not limited to owned or existing ERC20 tokens. MARKET is designed to facilitate risk transference and trading in a trustless manner.
